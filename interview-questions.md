# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is a way to reference a class in a separate component.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: In object-oriented programming, it is viewed as every piece of code is within an object. If the code is within an object simply methods are used. It's a continuous interactive workflow.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is the style of programming concepts based on being objects. OOP can contain data and code, the object's own process can access and modify the data fields in itself.  



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a decimal number, an integer is a whole number.

  Researched answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is the value associated with each. A Float is any number that contains a decimal point, an Integer is a whole number or number without a decimal point. They are different forms of numerical data.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return refers to the last line of a method or conditional. The last line of either will be returned without adding prints/puts to the line. It is implied that the last line will be the output.

  Researched answer: An implicit return means the value/elements in the last line of a set method will be returned/ outputted without having to add the keyword return like methods/functions in other languages.
